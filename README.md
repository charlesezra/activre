The purpose of this application is to be able to use the active recall studying technique through a web app. I noticed that people use this technique with Google Sheets all manually, and I wanted to make a dedicated web app that will make it easier for the user to create these components.

Also, this is a working project and it is not done yet. I will continue to work on this throughout the fall semester and I am projecting that I will have a working prototype towards the end. I hope it will impact students' studying when it is released.

I am continuously learning the technologies being used through online documentation and tutorials.

Learning more about:
* JavaScript
* Web Development - Full Stack
* Containerization
* Server Architecture
